# hpc-fmri

Template batch scripts for fMRI processing on the Caltech Resnick HPC cluster

These SLURM batch scripts should be edited to match your group setup and dataset structure and depend on additional files, include singularity images for fmriprep and mriqc, and conda installation of bidskit and dcm2niix.

Please contact @jmtyszka for further help with setup and access to singularity images
